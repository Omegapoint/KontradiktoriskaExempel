    "\n",
    "We have seen that a Convolutional Neural Network works much better at recognizing hand-written digits than the simple linear model in Tutorial #01. The Convolutional Network gets a classification accuracy of about 99%, or even more if you make some adjustments, compared to only 91% for the simple linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the Convolutional Network is also much more complicated to implement, and it is not obvious from looking at the filter-weights why it works and why it sometimes fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we would like an easier way to program Convolutional Neural Networks and we would also like a better way of visualizing their inner workings."
